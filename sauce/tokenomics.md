#### puzzle pieces for an algorithmic monetary policy that encourages self-stabilizing behavior in a utility-driven token
- theoretical framework relies on
    - quantitative modeling -> game theory (equilibria, one-shot strategies, cooperation in repeated games, moral hazard, collusion, auctions)
    - qualitative modeling -> non-neutral money, methodological individualism + evolutionary influences, price signals, self-organization
        - short summary of some of the  concepts: https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AustrianSchoolofEconomics.html 

- interesting ideas and implementations
